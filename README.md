## tvdbshowinfo
My test programs to learn the TVDB api

### showmovie, showseries, showext
Reports info about movie/series. Requires `APIKey` and `ID` from TVDB as arguments

### multiShowInfo
Dumps info in seperate JSON's for each

### tvdbSearch
Lets you search TVDB, select from the results and get info about series, companies, movies, people or lists. Requires `APIKey`, and you can optionally enter search queries as arguments.
This works best with a tall terminal, as the info output and lists are often quite long
